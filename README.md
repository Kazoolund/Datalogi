# P1 program for group A313

To compile the project, type `make`.

Hopefully it should produce the two binaries `master` and `worker`.

First start off by running the master program and answer the questions it asks.

Then start the correct amount of worker programs, and answer the questions they ask.

The master will start delegating tasks between the nodes when it has the correct amount of workers connected.
